I decided to put together a personal website as an exercise to learn a bit of HTML, and to create a space to collect some of my personal projects. 

I had seen a few examples of personal sites made with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> using Github Pages, and the availability of <a href="https://paulle.ca/jekyll-tutorials">tutorials</a> and <a href="https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme">templates</a> made it seem like a good place to start with HTML. 

I seem to have grabbed the basics at least, because here I am: publishing my first post!
