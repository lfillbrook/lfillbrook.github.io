After completing my PhD in 2023, I was fortunate enough to do some travelling around Europe with my partner. We hopped in our van and spent a few months immersed in wilderness, camping in remote locations spanning several countries, hiking, cycling and wild swimming in the most beautiful landscapes. For two active nature lovers, it was absolute bliss, and just the reset I needed after submitting my PhD thesis.

One country that stood out to me was Switzerland – and not just for its ubiquitous mountain views and cascading waterfalls. As an environmentalist, I’m keenly interested in renewable energy, so I was very excited to visit several of Switzerland’s hydroelectric dams and get up-close to the incredible feats of engineering.

I couldn’t pass on the chance to visit the tallest gravity dam in the world: the [Grande Dixence dam](https://www.grande-dixence.ch/en/the-complex/dams/grande-dixence-78/), just a short, scenic drive from the town of Sion. The monumental 285 m high dam contains the Lac des Dix which holds up to 400 M m<sup>3</sup> of cloudy blue water, collected from 35 glaciers, and represents 20% of the storable energy produced in Switzerland.

Interestingly, the Grande Dixence was not the first dam to sit in this valley. Constructed between 1930-35 the original Dixence dam had a storage capacity of 50 M m<sup>3</sup> of water (just 12.5% that of the Grande Dixence) and is now submerged in the Lac des Dix. The Grande Dixence dam was built in 1951-61, just 350 m downstream of the original, to serve the growing power generation needs of the population after the Second World War. To increase the capacity of the dam, the [Cleuson dam](https://www.grande-dixence.ch/en/the-complex/dams/cleuson-82/) was built in a nearby valley to collect water before pumping it up to the Lac de Dix. 

Sat contemplating this spectacular hydroelectric expansion project, I couldn’t help but think of the ongoing Snowy Hydro 2.0 project in NSW. While the projects are very different, both share the common goal of expanding existing hydroelectric schemes to leverage hydropower as a sustainable energy source in response to growing demand for electricity. 

As Australia transitions to Net-Zero, the NEM will need to triple its generating capacity according to [AEMO’s draft 2024 ISP](https://aemo.com.au/consultations/current-and-closed-consultations/draft-2024-isp-consultation). While there has been a wide uptake of solar and wind power, these renewable energy sources are variable and long duration storage in the form of pumped-hydro will provide much needed stability to the NEM. I only hope Snowy 2.0 can overcome the soaring costs, delays and engineering challenges so that I might be able to see it completed in my lifetime!
