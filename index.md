I am an enthusiastic problem solver, accomplished researcher and keen environmentalist.

I have recently been awarded a PhD in Chemistry from UNSW, under the supervision of <a href=" https://bevesgroup.wordpress.com/">Jon Beves</a>, for research focused on molecular motion in dynamic solutions. Throughout this largely physical chemistry project, I quickly mastered new techniques (including diffusion NMR spectroscopy and confocal microscopy) that were required for studies on diverse systems. I collaborated with multidisciplinary teams, both at UNSW and around the world, resulting in several high impact <a href=" https://lfillbrook.github.io/publications ">publications</a>. 

Through the varied projects of my PhD, I was generating large datasets that required complex processing procedures. This led me to develop a passion for coding, particularly with Python, as I was able to automate what could have been extremely laborious processing procedures using <a href=" https://github.com/lfillbrook ">scripts that I had written</a> or edited. I further developed these skills to build mathematical simulations which could be used to gain new understanding about chemical systems. Having found these skills so crucial in my research, I began volunteering with the <a href=" https://www.girlsprogramming.network/ ">Girls Programming Network</a>, where I mentor and guide high school girls and gender minorities in programming exercises, in the hope of narrowing the developer gender gap.
